2. GitHub Pages will automatically update your live site
3. Changes may take a few minutes to appear

## 🎯 Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have your own domain name:

1. In your repository, create a file named `CNAME`
2. Put your domain name in the file (e.g., `spelling.yourdomain.com`)
3. Configure your domain's DNS to point to GitHub Pages
4. Follow GitHub's [custom domain guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

## 📱 Sharing Your Game

Once deployed, you can share your game by:

- **Direct Link**: Share the GitHub Pages URL
- **QR Code**: Generate a QR code for the URL for easy mobile access
- **Social Media**: Share screenshots and the link
- **School/Classroom**: Perfect for educational settings

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Game Not Loading
- Check that `index.html` is in the root directory
- Verify all file names are correct (case-sensitive)
- Look for any console errors in browser developer tools

### Audio Not Working
- This is normal on some mobile browsers
- Audio requires user interaction to start
- Make sure users click a button before expecting audio

### Words Not Saving
- This is expected - localStorage only works on the same device/browser
- Each user will need to add their own words
- Consider adding instructions for users

## 🌟 Pro Tips

1. **Test Locally First**: Always test your game by opening `index.html` in a browser before deploying
2. **Mobile Testing**: Test on phones and tablets since many kids use these devices
3. **Share Responsibly**: Remember this is for children - keep it safe and educational
4. **Get Feedback**: Ask teachers, parents, and kids to try it and give feedback
